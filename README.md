# Cowin Slots

Find vaccination slots on Cowin for your pincode and age group. This script uses the API provided by the Government of India [here](https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin).

This script will only display results if **slots are available** for the given age group.


## Requirements

This script requires Python3 to be installed along with the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests) library. Use the following command to install it.

```pip3 install requests```

Run it using the following command.

```python3 main.py```

Upon entering pin code and age, it will fetch all the vaccination centers with doses available for the provided age group in the next seven days.
